## Tools to work with bpmdj session files

BpmDJ is an application for performing accurate beat mixing with intelligent song analysis and dsp processing to make fantastic mixes.
It is available here http://bpmdj.yellowcouch.org/

As the tool has evolved from a Linux application to an Android application and now a Java application, its song management is tied closely
to the device it is installed on.  

These tools scan for bpmdj1 song analysis files, match and allow modification of bpmdj mix session files to re-connect songs with mixes.
